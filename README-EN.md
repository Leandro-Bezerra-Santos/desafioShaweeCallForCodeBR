The Call For Code Hackathon is an IBM initiative for Latin America that aims to collaborate with teams that wish to compete for the global award, providing tools for the preparation and qualification of projects that will be submitted in the Call for Code - Global Challenge, thus increasing their chances of getting a good rating.

For three days, participants will have access to mentoring, lives and expert content, immersing themselves in an environment of creativity and innovation, and all completely online and in the comfort of their own home.

### Challenge

<p>According to the United Nations, “the impacts of climate change are on a global and unprecedented scale. If we do not create drastic measures today, the adaptation of these impacts in the future will be more expensive and difficult”. Given the devastating and far-reaching effects of climate change, we have divided the Global Challenge 2021 into three sub-themes: Clean Water and Sanitation, Zero Hunger and Responsible Production and Green Consumption</p>
<p>Our theme will be <strong>HUNGER ZERO</strong></p>

      <br><strong>Zero Hunger</strong></br>
      <br>135 million people suffer from acute hunger, with climate change a major contributing factor. The technology can help farmers grow more crops in areas on the brink of drought or organizations quickly distribute perishables from small stores to local shelters.</br></br>

### Project

<p>The "Logali" platform integrates producers, cooperatives and the end consumer, stimulating more relationships between them in order to generate new partnerships and less loss of surplus.</p>

<p>Producers and cooperatives will have an easily accessible and usable platform on which they can conduct research to find new partners, locations and food distribution companies.</p>

<p>The final consumer will have a platform to find the producer and cooperatives in their region, in addition to helping the producer to reduce the cost of transporting their food as they will have direct contact with them.</p>
